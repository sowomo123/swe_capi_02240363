#dzongkha spell cheacker

# project over view
the main aim of this assignment is to check the incorrect value from the input data that we are assigned with our individual input data. It ensure the uniform spelling in a long documents such as libary  or a textbook, by doing this spell cheacker it reduce the proofreading and corrections. it will help to convey a messege more clearly and effectively

1 usage 
clean.txt is a file for processing a textual data including spell checking and correction. The command line argunment are dzongkhaspelling.py

5 challenges and solution
while importing the dictionary it was not able to read the textfile so from the dictionary which was in Ms words so in order to solve this issue , install a docx2txt in command promt. It use python-docx2txt library to read text from Microsoft Word documents. It is an improvement over python-docx library as it can, in addition, extract text from links, headers and footers. It can even extract images. You can install it by running: pip install docx2txt.
